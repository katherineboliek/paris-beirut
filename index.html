      <h4>Beirut &amp; Paris: media reactions<h4>
      <hr class="break">
      <!--paragraph-->
      <p>In the span of two days, Beirut, Lebanon and Paris, France were attacked by terrorists leaving 43 dead in Beirut and 130 in Paris. Within hours of when the Paris attack started, social media was full of people posting about it.</p>
      <p>Hashtags PrayforParis, ParisAttacks and Paris shot up across Twitter and Instagram. Facebook revealed new features like the ability to check in as safe and temporary profile pictures overlaid with the French flag to show support.</p>
      <p>None of this happened for Beirut. In fact, the hashtags PrayforBeirut, BeirutAttacks and Beirut spiked at the same time as the Paris hashtags. Most people did not even know about the Beirut bombing until seeing it compared to Paris on their social media feeds. The trends for Beirut came about as people noticed that this similar tragedy had hardly been mentioned on their social media.</p>
      <p>More and more people called out the disparity of the mediaâ€™s reaction and coverage of the two attacks. Several media outlets covered the topic themselves, referencing many factors such as Western bias, familiarity with Paris, and frequency of violence in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>But was it truly the fault of the media for not publishing more articles on the attacks or is the Western population the problem, remaining for the most part disinterested in hearing about news from the Middle East?</p>
