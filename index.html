      <h1>Two Days, Two Attacks</h1>
      <h4>Beirut &amp; Paris reactions compared<h4>
      <hr class="break">
      <!--paragraph-->
      <p>In the span of two days, Beirut, Lebanon and Paris, France were attacked by terrorists leaving 43 dead in Beirut and 130 in Paris. Social media provided a platform for people to share their sympathies and opinions on the situations. It became apparent that the world was much more sympathetic to France than to Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Within hours of when the Paris attack started, social media was full of supportive posts. People began supporting Beirut at the same time, but mostly as a part of calling out the disparity of the media’s reaction and coverage of the two attacks.</p>
      <p>The question that many eventually asked on social media was whether it’s truly the fault of the media for not publishing more articles on the Beirut attacks or if the Western population the problem, remaining for the most part disinterested in hearing about news from the Middle East?</p>
